    <p>In context of search engines, <a href="https://queryunderstanding.com/search-results-clustering-b2fa64c6c809">search result clustering</a>
    is much more effective in communicating the relevant subtopics
    related to the query than the traditional list view of hyperlinks. This is crucial in case of broader queries
    (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_needs#:~:text=It%20is%20the%20actual%2C%20but,field%20to%20get%20an%20answer.">conscious
    information need</a> - user does not know enough about a subject to form a narrow specific query; presence of ambiguity)
    for which documents from multiple subtopics can be relevant. Typically, clustering of search results is envisioned
    as a post processing step of the retrieved results where a clustering algorithm is applied only on the vector
    representations (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf#:~:text=The%20tf%E2%80%93idf%20is%20the,document%20or%20a%20web%20page.">tfidf</a>)
    of the retrieved documents. However, we hypothesize a more direct involvement of the
    query to the clustering process is necessary to be able to generate subtopic clusters that are particularly relevant
    for the query (this is even more apparent for broad queries where there can be multiple clustering of the same set
    of retrieved docuements) i.e. we need query-specific subtopic clustering. In this work, we develop a query-specific
    siamese similarity metric (QS3M) that can be leveraged with any distance-based clustering algorithm (e.g.
    <a href="https://www.datanovia.com/en/lessons/agglomerative-hierarchical-clustering/">HAC</a>) to
    obtain query-specific subtopic clustering.</p>

    <p><b>How QS3M works</b> - QS3M provides a similarity score for a triplet of a query and a pair of passage/ documents represented
    as document embeddings using <a href="https://www.sbert.net/">Sentence-BERT</a>.
    A siamese neural network is used to project the pair of passages and the query in the same latent embedding space
    (q', pi', pj'). Then another MLP layer obtains the similarity score from the concatenated interaction vectors
    (pi'-pj', pi'-q', pj'-q') and the individual passage vectors (pi', pj'). Input to the siamese neural networks is the
    sentence-BERT embeddings.</p>

    <p><b>How QS3M is trained</b> - It is trained as a binary classifier; each training sample is a triplet of a query and a
        pair of passages with a target binary label denoting whether the pair of passages should share the same cluster
        in context of the query. Binary classification loss (binary cross entropy) can be employed to optimize. Negative
        sampling is used to balance the dataset.</p>
